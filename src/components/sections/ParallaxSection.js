            to becoming a seasoned professional in the world of technology and
            coding, my path has been one of relentless dedication and unwavering
            passion. I first encountered the digital realm at a young age, even
            before my relocation to the United States. My innate curiosity led
            me to explore coding languages such as Lua, HTML, and CSS. I honed
            my skills and crafted my first website before reaching middle
            school. This early introduction to web development foreshadowed a
            lifelong fascination with technology.

            However, my journey was not confined to code alone. My
            entrepreneurial spirit emerged as I established my own service,
            providing doorstep electronics repair services to my community. This
            initiative underscored my commitment to delivering technical
            solutions and ingrained in me the value of customer-centricity. Upon
            arriving in the United States, my passion for technology continued
            to flourish. I ventured into iOS app development, creating two
            successful applications that demonstrated my innovation and mastery
            of mobile software development.
