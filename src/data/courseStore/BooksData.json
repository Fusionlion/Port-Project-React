        "content": "Moral and ethical issues arise from the case of Edward Snowden. The ethical problem entails what the government documented as a violation of the Espionage Act of 1917. This identifies the leak of state secrets to the public or the country's adversaries as an act of treason. Secondly, he was complicit of his actions; he considered what the NSA was doing as evil. As a member of the NSA, he had signed some of the terms of working. The conditions include the privacy of any company information. Therefore, there is a population that shuns his act since they believe in organizational privacy when considering his action of breaking the treaty that he had signed. Besides, there were issues of morality that arose from his actions. He defended his actions by the claim that he was doing it in good faith (Biography.com Editors, 2019). The government, through its agency NSA, was invading people's privacy; he strongly felt that he was obliged to expose this vice to the public regardless of his actions being illegal by law.There were supporters from the public who supported his actions stating that they were ethical since Snowden had acted in the sense of doing well to the American citizens. For instance, Radack said, 'Snowden may have violated a secrecy agreement, which is not a loyalty oath but a contract, and less important than the social contract a democracy has with its citizenry.'Others from the public agreed that his actions were legally culpable. However, they were not to be considered unethical because the law itself was unjust, and the espionage act was unconstitutional.  Thus, they wanted Snowden to be free; they found him a hero, and the government should not consider Snowden as a traitor. Just like the public, I should be concerned about Edward's case because his actions are like a coin, from a view; I consider his actions unethical. When gauged again, from another perspective, he is like a savior of my privacy, and there should be a need for the whole case not to be politicized.There are two theories applicable to this case: Kant's moral theory and Social contract theory. Kant's philosophy is favorable to this case in that his approach is as a result of enlightenment rationalism. Kant's theory bases one's actions on the view that whatever one does is a good thing and was done for goodwill (Wood, 2007). Therefore, the wrongness or the rightness of one's action will not depend on the consequences that are already determined but on the fact that the individual has fulfilled a duty intended. To Kant, there was one principle that should apply in situations; the categorical imperative, which will then determine the morality of our actions. In the formulation of the theory, there were three things that one needs to consider or rather understand with regards to the categorical imperative. An individual needs to understand a maxim, basic idea, and an attachment of detail. Therefore, Kant argues that a person is either right, depending on the motivation behind their actions. One's works can be considered good if the individual did them out of moral worthiness, and they are wrong if they are based on one's emotions of irrationality or motivated by personal interests. In our case, when we use this theory, Edward's defense was that his exposure of the secrets of NSA was because his intentions were based on sharing the information with the public. Henceforth, Kant would consider them to be moral. This is because Edward's basic idea for the action was for the public good and the fact that they were not motivated by personal interests. To affirm that his actions were right, Edward is even prepared to be prosecuted relatively at the court of law. Snowden wishes to be granted clemency for his actions. Additionally, there is no information provided to prove that he gained some money from the enemies of the state to do what he did; hence his motive was not for his gain.Social contract theory states that people will live together in peace and harmony by accepting communal morality and political morality. This is to say that a community will live believing in the social contract. Hence, it requires everyone to adhere to the set rules on their own choice since there are consequences of every decision made. In the United States, the constitution is part of America's social contract (Riley, 2013). Citizens and foreigners who will choose to live in America accept to be controlled by the political rules and morals that are outlined in the constitution. This ensures that no one in the community should be considered more significant not to adhere to them as it breaks the framework for the harmony of people living in America. Considering Snowden's case, his actions of revealing the secrets of the government went against the social contract of America.  His defense, to the Attorney of the government, was not convincing enough because his actions broke the law. Also, his actions had caused harm to national security since the enemies of the state could easily use it to attack the country.  Thus, Edward Holder had to be accountable for his actions. Moreover, they leaked the information through newspapers instead of him following the legal channels and filing his claims so that the government could be held responsible by using the constitution. Through the law, he could keep the Americans safe from the enemies since they could not have any access to national-security data.In conclusion, some measures need to be put in place to avoid a similar case in the future. The standards are to help the rest of the public to understand the ethics behind Edward's case. Also, the public needs to develop a better understanding of the ethics that are applied in IT (Reynolds, 2018, p.24). Their decisions on any issue should recognize the keen consideration of the laws set in the country.ReferencesBiography.com Editors. (2019, September 18).
